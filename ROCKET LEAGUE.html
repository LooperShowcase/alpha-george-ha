        Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published
        by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and
        PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch
        being released later on. In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a
        physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner
        Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking over those duties by the end of
        2017. Versions for macOS and Linux were also released in 2016, but
        support for their online services was dropped in 2020. The game went
        free-to-play in September 2020. Described as "soccer, but with
        rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to
        each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into
        their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The
        game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played
        both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all
        versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core
        rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and
        basketball.
