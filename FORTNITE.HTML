        Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in
        2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that
        otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite:
        Save the World, a cooperative hybrid-tower defense-shooter-survival game
        for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend
        objects with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle
        Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players
        fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, in which
        players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.
        Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access
        titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. While the Save
        the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games,
        Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and
        a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less
        than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. Fortnite
        as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up until December 2019.
