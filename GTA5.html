        Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar
        North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in
        the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and
        the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San
        Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows
        three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster
        Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their
        attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government
        agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players freely
        roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos,
        based on Los Angeles.
